# Welcome
Check out the self contained [jupyter notebook](numerical_integration_damped_harmonic_d17397nr.ipynb) for numerical integration schemes, accuracy comparisons, animations of phase space and more.<br>
To view animations you may need to download and run the notebook yourself, I recommend running all cells then reading the sections you are interested in.
